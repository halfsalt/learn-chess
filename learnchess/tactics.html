            <p>Chess tactics are moves that help you gain an advantage or create opportunities to attack your opponent's piece. They are the building blocks of chess and when they fall, the game falls with them.</p>

            <h2> Basic Tactics </h2>

            <h3> Fork </h3>
            <p> A fork is a move where a single piece attacks two or more enemy pieces at the same time, forcing your opponent to decide which piece to save. For example, a knight can fork a king and a rook, or a queen can fork a bishop and a knight.</p>

            <h3> Pin </h3>
            <p>  A pin is a move where you attack an opponent's piece in a way that it cannot move without exposing a more valuable piece behind it. For example, if you attack a bishop with a rook, and the bishop is protecting a queen, the bishop is pinned because if it moves, the queen will be exposed.</p>

            <h3> Skewer </h3>
            <p> A skewer is similar to a pin, but it involves attacking a more valuable piece behind a less valuable one. For example, if you attack a rook with a bishop, and the rook is protecting a queen, the rook is skewered because if it moves, the queen will be attacked.</p>

            <h3> Double Attack</h3>
            <p>A double attack is a move where you attack two of your opponent's pieces at the same time, forcing your opponent to choose which one to save. For example, a knight can attack a bishop and a pawn at the same time.</p>

            <h3> Discovered Attack</h3>
            <p> A discovered attack is a move where a piece is moved, revealing an attack by another piece behind it. For example, if you move a bishop out of the way, and it reveals an attack by a rook behind it, that's a discovered attack.</p>

            <h3> Deflection</h3>
            <p> A deflection is a move where you force an opponent's piece to move away from a valuable square or a piece that it was defending. For example, if you attack a queen with a knight, and the queen moves to a square where it's no longer defending a bishop, you can then capture the bishop.</p>

            <p> These are just a few of the basic chess strategies that might give you an edge on the board. It's critical to remember that strategic positional play and a sound strategy are just as vital for winning the game as good tactics.</p>
