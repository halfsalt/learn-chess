            <p>The phrase "endgame" in the context of chess refers to the final phase of the game, when few pieces remain on the board and the result of the game is frequently decided by careful and strategic play. The objective of the endgame is to trap your opponent's king, preventing it from moving without being captured, to checkmate it. You must prevent your opponent from doing the same while also making the best use of your remaining pieces to accomplish this.</p>

                <h2>Endgame Outcomes</h2>

                <h3> Checkmate</h3>
                <p>Checkmate occurs when a player's king is under attack (in check), and there is no legal move to get out of check. In this case, the game is over, and the player whose king is in checkmate loses the game. Every player should strive to putting their opponent into checkmate.</p>

                <h4> Checkmate Patterns </h4>
                <p>Checkmate patterns are specific arrangements of pieces on the chessboard that result in a checkmate, meaning the opponent's king is in a position where it is under attack and cannot escape capture. Here are a few common checkmate patterns</p>

                <p> Smothered mate: This occurs when the defending king is surrounded by its own pieces, leaving no escape squares. The attacking knight then delivers checkmate by capturing a piece that is defending the king, causing the king to be unable to move and hence be checkmated</p>

                <p>Scholar's mate: This is a simple but effective checkmate that can catch beginners off guard. It involves the attacking player moving their bishop and queen to target f7 or f2, which are the weakest squares in the early stages of the game. </p>
                <img src="Images/scholared-mate.png" alt="Scholared Mate" class="centered-image">
                <p>Anastasia's mate: This is a fantastic checkmate that involves sacrificing the queen to deliver checkmate with a knight and bishop. It requires careful coordination of the attacking pieces to execute.</p>
                <img src="Images/Anastasias-Mate.png" alt="Anastasia's Mate" class="centered-image">
                <p>Legall's mate: To achieve checkmate with the queen and knight, one must sacrifice a bishop in this uncommon but impressive checkmate. To execute, it needs to be positioned precisely and timed.</p>

                <h3> Draws and Stalemates</h3>
                <p> Draw is a result in chess when neither player wins the game. This can happen in various situations, such as when there is a perpetual check, where the same sequence of checks keeps repeating, or when both players have no material left on the board to deliver checkmate, or when both players agree to a draw, or when the game is declared a draw by a specific rule (like the 50-move rule or threefold repetition rule).</p>
                <p> Stalemate occurs when a player's king is not in check, but the player has no legal moves left. In this case, the game is a draw, and neither player wins or loses. Stalemate is often a tactic used by the player who is losing to try and salvage a draw.</p>

            <p> These three outcomes are crucial to comprehend in chess because they have a significant impact on game outcomes and have an impact on a player's strategy and decision-making.</p>
